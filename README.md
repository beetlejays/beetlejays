# Hi there I am Jay ðŸ¤“

On the road to becoming an awesome web developer ðŸ’» 
When IÂ´m not coding, I enjoy:

- Any kind of sports :runner: :muscle: :basketball:
- Being outdoors :sunglasses:
- Reading about tech stuff and being a nerd :computer: :camera: 
- Movies and podcasts
- Enjoying the company of friends :raised_hands:
- Having the occasional BBQ :)
