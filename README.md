# Hi there I am Jay ðŸ¤“

Currently I am a Trainee at [Neue Fische](https://www.neuefische.de) on the road to becoming a web developer ðŸ’» 
When IÂ´m not coding, I enjoy:

- Any kind of sports :runner:
- Being outdoors
- Reading about tech stuff and being a nerd
- Enjoying the company of friends
- Having the occasional BBQ :)
