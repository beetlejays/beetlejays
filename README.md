# Hi there IÂ´m Jay ðŸ¤“

and I am a Developer ðŸ’» - a design mediadesign senior and movie nerd.

When IÂ´m not coding, I enjoy:

- Any kind of sports :runner: :muscle: :basketball:
- Being outdoors :sunglasses:
- Reading about tech stuff and being a nerd :computer: :camera: 
- Movies and podcasts
- Enjoying the company of friends :raised_hands:
- Having the occasional BBQ :)

And here is some experience what I have been working on recently.
